Aspiring Data Analyst
---------------------

<p align="left">Hello, my name is Nilesh. I live in North West London. I achieved a 2:1 degree in Law and Politics from the University of Keele I am a big fan of watching, reading about and listening to sports content and it has been fascinating to see how data has grown and developed in that field. It started as a descriptive diagnostic tool, then became vital in analysing performance and now increasingly is key in decision making. 
</p>
<p align="left">This pattern has been replicated across every aspect of life and shows no sign of slowing down. It is an interesting and obviously important field hence the data bootcamp was of a strong interest to me in order to start gaining the skillset that I need to work in this area. The other main attraction of moving into data was that I have already had a successful career in IT but have had a career break. The bootcamp has given me the chance to upskill into new areas. I can make the transition into a data role with the confidence of a proven track record of being able to learn and master these types of skillsets. 
</p>
I have worked in a variety of roles in IT, I started working in small and medium sized companies where typically you are the ‚Äòall rounder‚Äô who has to do a bit of everything. I then moved on to big service companies like Capgemini and Fujitsu where I worked on government projects for the MoD and the Cabinet Office amongst others. These were high profile, large scale, high complexity projects, I am used to the demands of such work. All this has given me excellent analytic, problem solving and troubleshooting skills. A lot of experience in maintaining and delivering a service. The ability to work collaboratively and communicate effectively with a wide range of different people at all levels. With my work history plus the bootcamp I am well suited to a role in data administration or as a data analyst. I am also open to an Apprenticeship in a data field as I like to learn things from the foundations up. As mentioned I am a big sports fan and my favourite thing is the football World Cup. I have been to 5 Mens World Cup tournaments across three continents and am hoping to go to more in the future
